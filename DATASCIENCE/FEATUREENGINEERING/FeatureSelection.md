## What is **Feature Selection**?

**Feature Selection** is the process of **choosing the most relevant input variables (features)** from your dataset that contribute the most to your model's predictive power.

> In simple terms: It's about keeping **only the important columns** and **removing the unnecessary ones** to make your model more accurate and efficient.

## Why is Feature Selection Important?

| Benefit                                 | Description                                                        |
| ----------------------------------------| ------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Improves Model Performance**         | Reduces overfitting and increases accuracy.                        |
| **Speeds Up Computation**              | Fewer features = faster training and prediction.                   |
| **Reduces Noise**                      | Removes irrelevant or redundant data.                              |
| **Simplifies Model**                   | Easier to interpret and debug.                                     |
| **Avoids the Curse of Dimensionality** | Too many features can make models unstable and less generalizable. |

## Types of Feature Selection Methods

Feature selection methods can be grouped into three main categories:

### **Filter Methods**

* Use **statistical techniques** to evaluate feature relevance **independently of any model**.
* Examples:

  * Correlation coefficient
  * Chi-squared test
  * Mutual Information

### **Wrapper Methods**

* Use a **machine learning model** to evaluate feature subsets and pick the best one.
* Examples:

  * Recursive Feature Elimination (RFE)
  * Forward selection
  * Backward elimination

### **Embedded Methods**

* Feature selection is **part of the model training process**.
* Examples:

  * Lasso Regression (L1 regularization)
  * Tree-based models (Random Forest, XGBoost) â†’ `feature_importances_`

##  Common Feature Selection Techniques in Python (Scikit-Learn)

###  Univariate Selection (Filter)

```python
from sklearn.feature_selection import SelectKBest, f_classif
selector = SelectKBest(score_func=f_classif, k=5)
X_selected = selector.fit_transform(X, y)
```

###  Recursive Feature Elimination (Wrapper)

```python
from sklearn.feature_selection import RFE
from sklearn.linear_model import LogisticRegression
model = LogisticRegression()
rfe = RFE(model, n_features_to_select=5)
X_selected = rfe.fit_transform(X, y)
```

###  Feature Importance from Tree Models (Embedded)

```python
from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestClassifier
model = RandomForestClassifier()
model.fit(X, y)
importances = model.feature_importances_
```

## How to Choose Features

| Consideration        | What to Ask                                                |
| -------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Relevance**        | Does this feature affect the target variable?              |
| **Redundancy**       | Is it highly correlated with another feature?              |
| **Data Type**        | Is it categorical, numerical, date/time?                   |
| **Missing Values**   | Does this feature have too many NaNs?                      |
| **Domain Knowledge** | Is this feature logically important in real-world context? |

## For Different Data Types

| Data Type            | Strategy                                                   |
| -------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Numerical**        | Correlation, Variance Threshold                            |
| **Categorical**      | Chi-square, Mutual Info, One-hot encoding before selection |
| **Datetime**         | Extract parts (month, day, weekday), then check relevance  |
| **Text**             | TF-IDF(Term Frequency)-(Inverse Document Frequency) + model-based feature importance                    |
| **High Dimensional** | Use dimensionality reduction (PCA, Autoencoders)           |
