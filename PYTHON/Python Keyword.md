| `is`        | Checks for object identity (whether two references point to the same object).      |
| `lambda`    | Creates an anonymous function.                                                     |

# Identifiers & Variables

    Python Identifiers:

        Python Identifier is the name we give to identify a variable, function, class, module or other object.

        Sometimes variable and identifier are often misunderstood as same but they are not

    Variable:

        A variable, as the name indicates is something whose value is changeable over time. 
        In fact a variable is a memory location where a value can be stored. 
        Later we can retrieve the value to use. 
        But for doing it we need to give a nickname to that memory location so that we can refer to it. 
        Thatâ€™s identifier, the nickname.

        Example:

        myVariable = "hello world"
            print(myVariable)

        explanation:

        myVariable -> Identifier
        "hello world" -> Value Stored
        print(my variable) -> This outputs the value by using the identifier

        var1 = 1
            print(var1)

        explanation:

        var1 -> Identifier
        "1" -> Value Stored
        print(var1) -> This outputs the value by using the identifier


| Term       | Description                            | Example                             |
| ---------- | -------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------- |
| Identifier | The name used to identify a variable   | `myVariable`                        |
| Variable   | A memory location holding the value    | `myVariable` stores `"hello world"` |
| Value      | The actual data stored in the variable | `"hello world"`                     |
