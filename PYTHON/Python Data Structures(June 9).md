# Data Structures

1. What is Data Structure?

        A data structure is a way to store and organize data so that it can be accessed and modified efficiently.

        Python provides several built-in data structures, each suited for different types of tasks.

    Built-in Data Structures in Python:

    1. List: List is a collection which is ordered and changeable. Allows duplicate members.  
    2. Tuple is a collection which is ordered and unchangeable. Allows duplicate members.
    3. Set is a collection which is unordered, unchangeable*, and unindexed. No duplicate members.
    4. Dictionary is a collection which is ordered** and changeable. No duplicate members. 

# Built-in Data Types:

    1. List:

        List items are ordered, changeable, and allow duplicate values.
        List items are indexed, the first item has index [0], the second item has index [1] etc.

    |      Feature            |                Description                 |
    | ----------------------- | ------------------------------------------ |
    |      Ordered            | Items maintain the order you add them      |
    |      Mutable            | You can change, add, remove items          |
    |      Indexed            | Access items by position (starting from 0) |
    |   Allows duplicates     | Same value can appear multiple times       |

        Example:

            my_list = [item1, item2, item3, ...]


    2. Tuple: 

        Tuples are used to store multiple items in a single variable.
