# Flowchart

    Flowcharts are the visual representations of an algorithm or a process. Flowcharts use symbols/shapes like arrows, rectangles, and diamonds to properly explain the sequence of steps involved in the algorithm or process. Flowcharts have their use cases in various fields such as software development, business process modeling, and engineering.
