# Flowchart

    Flowcharts are the visual representations of an algorithm or a process. Flowcharts use symbols/shapes like arrows, rectangles, and diamonds to properly explain the sequence of steps involved in the algorithm or process. Flowcharts have their use cases in various fields such as software development, business process modeling, and engineering.

1. Symbols:

    1. Start / End

        Symbol: üü† Oval / Ellipse
    
    Use: Marks where the process begins and ends.

    2. Input / Output

        Symbol: ‚¨õ Parallelogram
    
    Use: For user input or system output (e.g., entering values, displaying results).

    3. Process / Operation

        Symbol: üî≤ Rectangle
    
    Use: Represents a calculation, assignment, or task.

    4. Decision / Condition

        Symbol: ‚óá Diamond
    
    Use: Used for if/else, true/false, yes/no decisions.

    5. Arrows / Flowlines

        Symbol: ‚û°Ô∏è Arrow
    
    Use: Shows direction of flow.

    6. Connector (optional)

        Symbol: ‚ö™ Circle
    
    Use: Jump or connect flow when it continues on another page or is too complex.

# Statements vs Conditions 

1. Statement: 

    A statement is a line of code that tells the computer to do something. It is an instruction.

    Example:
        x = 10              # Assignment statement
        print(x)            # Output statement
        name = input()

    Statements perform actions.
    They do not return True or False.
    They are the steps of a program.

2. Condition:

    A condition is a logical expression that checks something and returns True or False.

    Example: 
        x > 0               # True if x is greater than 0
        x == 5              # True if x equals 5
        age >= 18           # True if age is 18 or more 

        if x > 0:
        print("Positive number")   # This runs only if the condition is True

    Conditions are used in decisions.
    They are written using comparison operators like ==, >, <, >=, <=, !=.
    Used in: if, while, for, etc.
