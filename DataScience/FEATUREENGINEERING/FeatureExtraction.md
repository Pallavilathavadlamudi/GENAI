##  What is **Feature Extraction**?

**Feature Extraction** is the process of **deriving new, meaningful features** from raw data to help machine learning models learn better.

> In simple terms: You **extract important information** from raw data and turn it into new columns (features) that can **improve model performance**.

---

## Why is Feature Extraction Important?

* Raw data (especially unstructured data) is often **not ready** for modeling.
* Helps models **understand patterns** in data more easily.
* Reduces the need for complex models by **adding domain-relevant signals**.
* Transforms **complex or unstructured inputs** into usable numerical/categorical forms.

## Examples of Feature Extraction by Data Type

| Data Type              | Feature Extraction Examples                                     |
| ---------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Datetime**           | Extract `year`, `month`, `day`, `hour`, `weekday`, `is_weekend` |
| **Text**               | Word count, TF-IDF, sentiment score, presence of keywords       |
| **Images**             | Pixel intensity, edges, deep features via CNNs                  |
| **Audio**              | Pitch, frequency spectrum, MFCCs                                |
| **Location (lat/lon)** | Distance from a central point, region encoding                  |
| **Categorical**        | Frequency encoding, count of category occurrence                |
| **Numerical**          | Ratio between columns, rolling averages, interaction terms      |

## Techniques Used in Feature Extraction

### For **Text Data**

* **Bag of Words (BoW)**
* **TF-IDF (Term Frequency – Inverse Document Frequency)**
* **Word embeddings** (e.g., Word2Vec, BERT)

### For **Datetime**

* Convert datetime to:

  * `Year`, `Month`, `Day`
  * `Hour of day` (for time-sensitive behavior)
  * `Day of week` (weekday/weekend analysis)
  * Cyclical encoding (e.g., using sine/cosine for hours/months)

### For **Numerical Data**

* Log or square root transformation
* Ratios or interaction between columns
* Statistical features: mean, median, min, max, standard deviation (e.g., over time windows)

### For **Images** (in deep learning)

* Extract features using **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)** or **autoencoders**

## Example in Python: Feature Extraction from Datetime

```python
import pandas as pd

# Example DataFrame
df = pd.DataFrame({'purchase_date': pd.to_datetime([
    '2024-07-01 10:30', '2024-07-02 13:45', '2024-07-03 16:00'])})

# Feature Extraction
df['year'] = df['purchase_date'].dt.year
df['month'] = df['purchase_date'].dt.month
df['hour'] = df['purchase_date'].dt.hour
df['weekday'] = df['purchase_date'].dt.weekday
df['is_weekend'] = df['weekday'] >= 5

print(df)
```

##  Best Practices

* Always combine **domain knowledge** with automated extraction.
* Avoid creating **too many features** (risk of overfitting).
* Use **feature importance** or **dimensionality reduction** later to keep only the useful ones.

| **Definition** | Creating new features from raw data to improve model learning      |
| **Goal**       | Capture relevant patterns or information in the data               |
| **Used When**  | Working with unstructured/semi-structured data (dates, text, etc.) |
| **Output**     | New, derived columns (features) for model input                    |

## What Are **Domain-Relevant Signals** in Feature Engineering?

**Domain-relevant signals** are **patterns, trends, or insights** in the data that are **specific to the field (domain)** you're working in — such as healthcare, finance, e-commerce, or manufacturing — and are important for making better predictions.

> In simple terms:
> A **signal** is something meaningful in the data. A **domain-relevant signal** is a **meaningful feature based on knowledge of your specific industry**.

---

## Why Are Domain-Relevant Signals Important?

Because machine learning models **do not have context** — they only understand data in numerical form. As a data scientist, your job is to **inject that real-world understanding** into the dataset.

Without domain-relevant signals:

* Models might miss patterns or interpret noise as signal.
* You risk underfitting or creating irrelevant features.
* Insights may be statistically sound but **not useful** in real-life decision-making.

## Examples by Domain

| Domain            | Raw Data Example               | Domain-Relevant Signal                                                        |
| ----------------- | ------------------------------ | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **E-commerce**    | Product price, purchase time   | "Discount offered", "Day part (morning/evening)", "User type (new/returning)" |
| **Healthcare**    | Patient symptoms, test results | "Risk score", "BMI", "Chronic illness indicator"                              |
| **Finance**       | Stock prices, transaction logs | "Moving average", "Volatility index", "Insider trade flag"                    |
| **Manufacturing** | Machine sensor data            | "Failure probability", "Maintenance overdue", "Operational hours"             |
| **Education**     | Student activity logs          | "Engagement level", "Dropout risk score", "Assignment submission delay"       |

##  How to Create Domain-Relevant Signals

1. **Consult Domain Experts** – Talk to stakeholders or field experts who understand the business.
2. **Use External Data** – E.g., public holidays, weather, demographics, etc.
3. **Combine Features** – Use ratios, differences, or groupings (e.g., `sales per product per region`).
4. **Aggregate over Time** – E.g., `average purchase value in the last 30 days`.
