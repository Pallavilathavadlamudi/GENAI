### **Brief Journey of Data Science**

1. **Problem Understanding**
   → Identify the business problem or question to solve.

2. **Data Collection**
   → Gather data from sources like databases, APIs, files, or web.

3. **Data Cleaning**
   → Fix missing values, remove duplicates, and standardize formats.

4. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
   → Explore data using statistics and visualizations to find patterns.

5. **Feature Engineering**
   → Create new, meaningful variables to improve model performance.

6. **Model Building**
   → Train machine learning or statistical models on the data.

7. **Model Evaluation**
   → Test model accuracy using performance metrics.

8. **Deployment**
   → Integrate the model into a system or app for real-world use.

9. **Visualization & Communication**
   → Share insights with stakeholders using reports or dashboards.

10. **Feedback & Improvement**
    → Monitor, refine, and retrain models with new data as needed.
