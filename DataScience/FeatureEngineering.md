## **What is Feature Engineering?**

Feature Engineering is the process of transforming **cleaned raw data** into features (or attributes) that **better represent the underlying patterns** in the data — making it more suitable for machine learning models.

**In simpler terms:**
It’s about **creating**, **transforming**, and **selecting** the right inputs (features) that help your model learn effectively.

## **Feature Engineering Steps**

### 1️⃣ **Feature Extraction**

> Deriving new features from raw data.

* **Purpose**: Extract useful signals or patterns from raw, unstructured, or semi-structured data.
* **Examples**:

  * From a `date`, extract `year`, `month`, `weekday`.
  * From a `text`, extract number of words, sentiment score, or use TF-IDF.
  * From a `location`, extract distance from a known point.

### 2️⃣ **Feature Transformation**

> Modifying features to improve their scale, distribution, or format.

* **Purpose**: Make features more usable for models and improve performance.
* **Common Techniques**:

    | Task                  | Purpose                                               |
    | --------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------- |
    | **Imputation**        | Fill missing values to avoid data loss                |
    | **Outlier Handling**  | Avoid skewing model with extreme values               |
    | **Binning**           | Convert numerical values into categorical bins        |
    | **Log Transform**     | Normalize skewed data                                 |
    | **One-Hot Encoding**  | Convert categorical to numerical                      |
    | **Feature Splitting** | Extract parts from compound values                    |
    | **Scaling**           | Normalize feature values (standardization or min-max) |

### 3️⃣ **Feature Selection**

> Choosing the most relevant features for modeling.

* **Purpose**: Reduce overfitting, improve accuracy, and decrease computational cost.
* **Methods**:

  * **Filter methods** (correlation, chi-square, mutual information)
  * **Wrapper methods** (Recursive Feature Elimination - RFE)
  * **Embedded methods** (Lasso, tree-based feature importance)
* **Goal**: Keep only those features that meaningfully impact model predictions.

| Step                       | What it does                         | Example                               |
| -------------------------- | ------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------- |
| **Feature Extraction**     | Create new features from raw data    | Extract day/month from a timestamp    |
| **Feature Transformation** | Improve format/distribution of data  | Normalize income, encode city names   |
| **Feature Selection**      | Keep only the most relevant features | Use correlation or RFE to drop extras |
