## Why Do We Need Data Science?

In today‚Äôs world, data is everywhere ‚Äî from the clicks we make online to the health data from wearable devices. But **raw data alone isn‚Äôt valuable**. The true power lies in what we do with that data.

This is where **Data Science** steps in ‚Äî to turn **massive, messy, and complex data** into **actionable insights** and smarter decisions.

### Then vs Now

üîπ **Traditionally**:

* Data was small, structured (in tables), and manageable using Business Intelligence (BI) tools.

üîπ **Today**:

* We deal with **huge volumes** of data (Big Data)
* It‚Äôs often **unstructured or semi-structured** ‚Äî like text reviews, videos, audio, and sensor data
* This kind of data **can‚Äôt be handled by traditional tools**

So, we need **Data Science** to handle this complexity.

### Real-World Examples of Data Science in Action

#### 1. **Healthcare ‚Äì Predicting Diseases**

Hospitals use Data Science to:

* Predict who is at risk of heart disease
* Recommend personalized treatments using patient history and AI models
    Result: Faster diagnosis and better care

#### 2. **E-Commerce ‚Äì Smart Recommendations**

Amazon/Flipkart analyze your:

* Browsing, purchase, and feedback data
  They use this to:
* Recommend products with **collaborative filtering** and **machine learning**
    Result: Personalized shopping ‚Üí more sales

#### 3. **Ride-Sharing ‚Äì Dynamic Pricing**

Uber/Ola use Data Science to:

* Predict ETA, match drivers, and apply surge pricing based on demand
    Result: Efficient travel for customers and drivers

#### 4. **Banking ‚Äì Fraud Detection**

Banks process millions of transactions daily.

* Using **anomaly detection** and **classification models**, they detect suspicious activity
    Result: Reduced fraud and improved customer trust

#### 5. **Entertainment ‚Äì Netflix Recommendations**

Netflix analyzes:

* Viewing history, skips, likes
* Similar users‚Äô behavior
  They use this data to:
* Recommend content and decide what to produce next
    Result: Higher engagement and retention

###  What Does Data Science Enable?

Data Science empowers businesses and governments to:

1. **Reduce Costs** ‚Äì by identifying inefficiencies
2. **Make Faster, Smarter Decisions** ‚Äì using real-time insights
3. **Improve Products & Services** ‚Äì through feedback analysis
4. **Detect Risks Early** ‚Äì using predictive models
5. **Prevent Fraud** ‚Äì via behavioral pattern recognition

### Real Example ‚Äì Sentiment Analysis

Let‚Äôs say a mobile phone company wants to improve its next model.
They collect **user reviews** and use **sentiment analysis** (a Data Science technique) to:

* Understand user opinions
* Identify what people love or hate
   Outcome: Informed innovation, better customer satisfaction

###  So, Why Do We Need Data Science?

Because in a world overflowing with data:

* **We need to make sense of it**
* **We need to find patterns and meaning**
* **We need to act on those insights fast**

**Data Science is the bridge between raw data and intelligent action.**
It helps us move from guessing to knowing ‚Äî and from reacting to predicting.

### Why is Data Science **Interdisciplinary**?

**Data Science is considered an *interdisciplinary field*** because it brings together knowledge and techniques from **multiple domains** to solve complex real-world problems.

It‚Äôs not just about coding or statistics ‚Äî it‚Äôs a blend of several disciplines working together.

### Core Disciplines That Make Up Data Science:

| Discipline                                                 | Role in Data Science                                                                                                    |
| ---------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Statistics & Mathematics**                               | For understanding data distributions, patterns, and building models (e.g., regression, probability, hypothesis testing) |
| **Computer Science / Programming**                         | For writing code, automating tasks, building algorithms (using Python, R, SQL)                                          |
| **Domain Knowledge (Business, Healthcare, Finance, etc.)** | To ask the *right* questions and interpret results meaningfully within a specific context                               |
| **Machine Learning / AI**                                  | For making predictions, classifications, and learning from data automatically                                           |
| **Data Engineering**                                       | For collecting, storing, and managing data pipelines (e.g., databases, ETL)                                             |
| **Data Visualization / Communication**                     | For presenting insights clearly to stakeholders using charts, dashboards, and reports                                   |

### Why This Matters:

You can‚Äôt do effective Data Science with just one skill set. For example:

* A model that predicts customer churn is **useless** if you don‚Äôt understand the business context.
* A beautiful dashboard is **misleading** if the data wasn‚Äôt properly cleaned or understood statistically.

üëâ **True value comes from combining all these disciplines.**

### Summary:

> **Data Science is interdisciplinary because it merges knowledge from statistics, computer science, domain expertise, and communication to extract insights and solve problems using data.**

###  **RDBMS is *not* interdisciplinary by itself.**

###  What is RDBMS?

**RDBMS (Relational Database Management System)** is a **software system** used to store and manage **structured data** in a tabular format (rows and columns). 
Examples include MySQL, PostgreSQL, Oracle, and SQL Server.

It uses **SQL** to:

* Query data
* Update records
* Enforce relationships between tables (e.g., with foreign keys)

### Why It‚Äôs *Not* Interdisciplinary

> **RDBMS is a single discipline** ‚Äî it belongs primarily to the field of **database systems** and **computer science**.

It focuses on:

* Data storage
* Data integrity
* Query optimization
* Relational logic

These are **technical database concepts**, not a blend of multiple fields.

### When Does It Become Part of an Interdisciplinary Process?

It becomes **part of an interdisciplinary workflow** **when used in Data Science, Business Intelligence, or Software Engineering**, where you combine:

* **RDBMS (Database knowledge)**
* **Statistics** (to analyze stored data)
* **Programming** (to automate and extend queries via Python, R, etc.)
* **Domain Expertise** (to interpret what the data means)
* **Visualization** (e.g., using Power BI or Tableau)

### Summary:

* ‚ùå **RDBMS alone is not interdisciplinary** ‚Äî it's a structured data system rooted in computer science.
* ‚úÖ **Using RDBMS within a larger project** (like Data Science or BI) makes the work **interdisciplinary** because it brings in multiple knowledge areas to solve real-world problems.

#### 1. **Database Knowledge (RDBMS / SQL)**

You need to:

* Understand how to design efficient schemas
* Query large tables using SQL
* Ensure data integrity and normalization

**Discipline**: *Database Management / Computer Science*

#### 2. **Statistics / Mathematics**

Once you retrieve the data, you often need to:

* Calculate trends, averages, correlations
* Perform hypothesis testing or forecasting

**Discipline**: *Statistics / Mathematics*

#### 3. **Programming (Python, R)**

To automate data workflows or apply advanced models:

* Extract data using SQL in Python scripts
* Use pandas or NumPy to clean and transform it
* Train machine learning models

**Discipline**: *Computer Programming / Data Engineering*

#### 4. **Domain Knowledge**

You must **understand the business context**:

* In e-commerce: What does "churn" mean?
* In healthcare: What‚Äôs a critical patient metric?
* In finance: How is risk calculated?

This helps you ask the **right questions** and interpret the results meaningfully.

**Discipline**: *Business / Industry-specific Expertise*

#### 5. **Data Visualization / Communication**

Once analysis is done, you must:

* Create charts, dashboards, or reports
* Communicate findings clearly to non-technical stakeholders

**Discipline**: *Storytelling / Design / Communication*
