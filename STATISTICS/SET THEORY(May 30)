# SET THEORY

PROBLEM STATEMENT:
To analyze and predict the likelihood of customers liking, purchasing, and responding to a new product and its related variants?

1. SET THEORY:

        Set theory is a branch of mathematical logic that studies collections of objects, called sets. 
        A set is simply a group of distinct elements considered as a whole. 
        Sets are usually denoted using curly braces, 
        
        e.g.,

        {apple, banana, orange}

# Basic Terms

    Set: 
    A collection of distinct elements, e.g., A = {1, 2, 3}
    
    Element: 
    An object in a set. For example, 1 is an element of set A
    
    Subset: 
    A set whose elements are all contained in another set. If B = {1, 2}, then B is a subset of A
    
    Union (A ∪ B): 
    All elements in A, in B, or in both
    
    Intersection (A ∩ B): 
    Elements common to both A and B
    
    Difference (A - B): 
    Elements in A but not in B
