# Graph Theory

1. Social Networking:

        Social networking can be analyzed using graph theory by representing individuals as nodes and relationships as edges.

        Example:

        Social networks (like Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, etc.) can be modeled as graphs:

            üìå Graph Structure

            Nodes (Vertices): People or users.
            Edges (Links): Connections like friendships, followers, messages, etc.
            
2.  Graph Theory:

        Graph Theory is the study of relationships between different objects.

        Graph:
            A graph is a collection of various vertexes also known as nodes, and these nodes are connected with each other via edges. 

            Nodes (also called vertices) ‚Äî represent objects (e.g., people, places, computers).
            Edges (also called links) ‚Äî represent relationships or connections between those objects.

3. Degree in Graph Theory:

        Degree of a Node: The degree of a node is the number of edges connected to it.

        1. In a Undirected Graph:

                        A
                       / \
                      B - C

            Node A ‚Üí degree = 2 (connected to B and C)
            Node B ‚Üí degree = 2 (connected to A and C)
            Node C ‚Üí degree = 2 (connected to A and B)

        2. In a Directed Graph:

            In-degree: Number of edges coming into a node
            Out-degree: Number of edges going out from a node

                    A ‚Üí B ‚Üê C

                A: out-degree = 1, in-degree = 0
                B: out-degree = 0, in-degree = 2
                C: out-degree = 1, in-degree = 0
