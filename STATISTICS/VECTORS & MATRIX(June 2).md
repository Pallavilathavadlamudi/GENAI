# EQUATIONS 

1. What is equation?

    an equation is a mathematical statement that shows two expressions are equal, indicated by an equals sign (=).

    example: 5 + 3 = 8

    Types of Equations: 
    
    1. Linear Equations: 
        
        These are equations where the highest power of the variable is 1. 
        They are represented by the general form 
                
                    ax + b = 0,
             
             where 'a' and 'b' are constants. When graphed, they form a straight line

    2. Quadratic Equations: 
        
        These equations involve a variable raised to the power of 2. 
        They are typically written as 
        
                    ax² + bx + c = 0, 
            
            where 'a', 'b', and 'c' are constants

    3. Cubic Equations: 
        
        These equations involve a variable raised to the power of 3 and 
        They are generally represented as 
            
                    ax³ + bx² + cx + d = 0
            
            where 'a', 'b', 'c' and 'd' are constants

    4. Exponential Equations: 
    
        These equations involve exponential functions, 
        where the variable appears in the exponent 
                   
                    a^x = b

                f(x)=a(1+r)^{x}

            f(x)=	exponential growth function
            a	=	initial amount
            r	=	growth rate
            {x}	=	number of time intervals
