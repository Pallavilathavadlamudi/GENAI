# EQUATIONS 

1. What is equation?

    an equation is a mathematical statement that shows two expressions are equal, indicated by an equals sign (=).

    example: 5 + 3 = 8

    Types of Equations: 
    
    1. Linear Equations: 
        
        These are equations where the highest power of the variable is 1. 
        They are represented by the general form 
                
                    ax + b = 0,
             
             where 'a' and 'b' are constants. When graphed, they form a straight line

    2. Quadratic Equations: 
        
        These equations involve a variable raised to the power of 2. 
        They are typically written as 
        
                    ax² + bx + c = 0, 
            
            where 'a', 'b', and 'c' are constants
  
    3. Cubic Equations: 
        
        These equations involve a variable raised to the power of 3 and 
        They are generally represented as 
            
                    ax³ + bx² + cx + d = 0
            
            where 'a', 'b', 'c' and 'd' are constants

    4. Exponential Equations: 
    
        These equations involve exponential functions, 
        where the variable appears in the exponent 
                   
                    a^x = b

                f(x)=a(1+r)^{x}

            f(x)=	exponential growth function
            a	=	initial amount
            r	=	growth rate
            {x}	=	number of time intervals     


# LINEARITY AND EXPONENTIALITY 

1. Linearity:

        Constant Rate of Change: A linear relationship has a constant rate of change, meaning the value increases or decreases by the same amount over each time period. 
        
        Example: A salary that increases by $1,000 every year is a linear increase. 
    
        Graph: A linear graph is a straight line. 
        
        Equation: y = mx + b, where 'm' is the constant rate of change (slope) and 'b' is the y-intercept

2. Exponentiality:

        An exponential relationship has a constant rate of percent change, meaning the value is multiplied by the same factor (e.g., 1.05 for a 5% increase) over each time period. 
        
        Example: Money in a savings account that earns 5% interest annually is an example of exponential growth. 
        
        Graph: An exponential graph is a curve. 
        
        Equation: y = a * b^x, where 'a' is the initial value and 'b' is the growth factor (base)


# Multiple Linear Equations

    A multiple linear equation is a mathematical representation of a relationship between a dependent variable and two or more independent variables.

    It's a statistical technique used to predict the outcome of a dependent variable by considering the combined influence of multiple factors.
    
    The outcome of the dependent variable is dependent on independent variable

    1. Difference between Linear Equation and multiple linear Equation?

    A linear equation involves variables raised to the power of one, while multiple linear equations incorporate two or more independent variables to predict a dependent variable

                y = b0 + b1x1 + b2x2 + ... + bnxn, 
                
            where y is the dependent variable, x1, x2, ... xn are the independent variables, 
            b0 is the y-intercept, and b1, b2, ... bn are the coefficients for each independent variable.
