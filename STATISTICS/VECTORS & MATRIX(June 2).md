# EQUATIONS 

1. What is equation?

    an equation is a mathematical statement that shows two expressions are equal, indicated by an equals sign (=).

    example: 5 + 3 = 8

    Types of Equations: 
    
    1. Linear Equations: 
        
        These are equations where the highest power of the variable is 1. 
        They are represented by the general form 
                
                    ax + b = 0,
             
             where 'a' and 'b' are constants. When graphed, they form a straight line

    2. Quadratic Equations: 
        
        These equations involve a variable raised to the power of 2. 
        They are typically written as 
        
                    axÂ² + bx + c = 0, 
            
            where 'a', 'b', and 'c' are constants
